# 🧑‍🍳 Active Record Recipes

A repository of common (and not so common) active record queries.

## 🙏 Contributing

Simply create a new branch off of `main`. Because each example may require a completely different database schema, the `main` branch is intentionally free of any models.

Each branch should serve as a stand-alone example and will not be merged into `main`. When your branch is complete, create a separate pull request to have it referenced in the `README`.

Please make sure the following items pass while building your feature branch

```bash
bin/rails test
bundle exec standardrb
```
